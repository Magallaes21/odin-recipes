    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of
       ground veal, pork and beef. You can also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) spaghetti package</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried organo</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) crushed tomato cans</li>
        <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite,
            about 12 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot and oregano
            into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
            Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
            and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil
            into the mixture.   
        </li>
        <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
       </ol>
